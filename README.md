# GraphQL

An example for graphql query:

```
{
    "query": "\n  query getCollectionProducts(\n    $handle: String!\n    $sortKey: ProductCollectionSortKeys\n    $reverse: Boolean\n  ) {\n    collection(handle: $handle) {\n      products(sortKey: $sortKey, reverse: $reverse, first: 100) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            ...product\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  fragment product on Product {\n    id\n    handle\n    availableForSale\n    title\n    description\n    descriptionHtml\n    options {\n      id\n      name\n      values\n    }\n    priceRange {\n      maxVariantPrice {\n        amount\n        currencyCode\n      }\n      minVariantPrice {\n        amount\n        currencyCode\n      }\n    }\n    variants(first: 250) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          id\n          title\n          availableForSale\n          selectedOptions {\n            name\n            value\n          }\n          price {\n            amount\n            currencyCode\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    featuredImage {\n      ...image\n    }\n    images(first: 20) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          ...image\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    seo {\n      ...seo\n    }\n    tags\n    updatedAt\n  }\n  \n  fragment image on Image {\n    url\n    altText\n    width\n    height\n  }\n\n  \n  fragment seo on SEO {\n    description\n    title\n  }\n\n\n",

## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is more than happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

- Shopify (this repository)
- [BigCommerce](https://github.com/bigcommerce/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://next-commerce-v2.vercel.app/))
- [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/vercel-commerce) ([Demo](https://medusa-nextjs-commerce.vercel.app/))
- [Saleor](https://github.com/saleor/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://saleor-commerce.vercel.app/))
- [Shopware](https://github.com/shopwareLabs/vercel-commerce) ([Demo](https://shopware-vercel-commerce-react.vercel.app/))
- [Swell](https://github.com/swellstores/verswell-commerce) ([Demo](https://verswell-commerce.vercel.app/))

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
